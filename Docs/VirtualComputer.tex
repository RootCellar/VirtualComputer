\section{Introduction}

This program is an implementation of virtual hardware that can be programmed with a language similar to assembly.
It includes emulation of a CPU and RAM, and may be expanded in the future to have a disk, and even internet access.
The language itself is intended to be an easier form of assembly, that makes for a great programming challenge, while
removing unnecessary difficulties.
