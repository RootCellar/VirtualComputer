- Decide how the RAM will be handled.

- The motherboard will house the modes for how the disk will be handled. (ie. Emulating a disk and storing as one binary file, or using the user's actual hard drive to make editing of files easier)

- Include clock rates on RAM and DISK (may be put off until everything works initially, then put some deeper technical details in)
