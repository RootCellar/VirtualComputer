# Todo

- Decide how the RAM will be handled.

- The motherboard will house the modes for how the disk will be handled. (ie. Emulating a disk and storing as one binary file, or using the user's actual hard drive to make editing of files easier)

- Include clock rates on RAM and DISK (may be put off until everything works initially, then put some deeper technical details in)

- Decide how adding multiple RAM and CPU objects might work.
	- RAM makes more sense, but CPU may be difficult. May have to include a way for one CPU to "jumpstart" another

- figure out how CPU interacting with other parts will work. Does the motherboard need it's own "instruction set"? CPU needs to be able to discover other virtual hardware objects to use them
