# Ideas

## GUI
---

### RAM Viewer

- A gui that allows the user to view the ram on the machine, possibly in multiple forms.
This would have to be expandable or have a scroll bar in the case of the RAM being somewhat large.

- Even more difficult could be a view of what the data in the RAM is. Ie, give the actual instruction names rather than numerical/binary form

### File Editor

- A file editor in the program to help the user edit files faster/easier

## Networking
---

- Enable implementation of a network device.
