## GUI
---

### RAM Viewer

- A gui that allows the user to view the ram on the machine, possibly in multiple forms.
This would have to be expandable or have a scroll bar in the case of the RAM being somewhat large.

### File Editor

- A file editor in the program to help the user edit files faster/easier
